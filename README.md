# hospital_management
A repository containing my code for High School Project, with the idea of creating a single-stop software for all hospital activities.
This has separate login portals for patients, doctors as well as administrators.

The entire software (over 1200 lines) has been coded up in Tkinter, and uses MySQL in the backend.
Any suggestions for further improvements are welcome!
